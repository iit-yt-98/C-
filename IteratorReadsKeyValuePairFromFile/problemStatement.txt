Parsing a Configuration File:

Problem: Implement a parser for a configuration file where each line contains a key-value pair separated by an equals sign (=).
Lines may include comments starting with a # symbol, and keys or values may have leading or trailing whitespace. 
Your parser should ignore comments and whitespace, and store the key-value pairs in an appropriate data structure.

Example Input:
# Sample configuration
host = localhost
port = 8080
# End of configuration
Expected Output: A data structure (e.g., std::map) containing {"host": "localhost", "port": "8080"}.
